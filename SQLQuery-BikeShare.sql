--  In this case, I am a data analyst working for Cyclistic, which is a fictional company in Chicago. Since its inception in 2016, Cyclistic has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. There are two types of customers: casual riders and annual members.
--I have been tasked to analyze how annual members and casual riders use Cylistic bikes differently based on a bike-share company’s data of its customer’s trip details from Jan-Oct 2021 to help the company maximize the number of annual memberships.
