My name is Khanh Pham and I am looking to transition from an accounting focus to a data
analytics focus. I am interested in an entry level Data/Business/Operations Analyst position. My
accounting experience has prepared me strong abilities to do critical thinking, spotting data
discrepancies, analyze, format, and handle large datasets. I believe my skillsets and experience
from my current job can be translated to a successful role in the data and analytics space.

I had recently taken the initiatives to further my skills in the data and analytics space by
completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. As part of this course, I was able
to gain some hands-on experience by completing a required data analysis case study to
showcase the skills learned throughout this course. For that case study, I used SQL for data
preparation and cleansing, and Tableau for data analysis and storytelling including preparing
visualization for presentation.
